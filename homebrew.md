  Updating Homebrew...
  ==> Downloading https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi?path=httpd/httpd-2.4.33.tar.bz2
  Already downloaded: /Users/rupert/Library/Caches/Homebrew/httpd-2.4.33.tar.bz2
  ==> ./configure --enable-layout=Slackware-FHS --prefix=/usr/local/homebrew/Cellar/httpd/2.4.33 --sbindir=/usr/local/homebrew/Cellar/httpd/2.4.33/bin --mandir=/usr/local/homebrew/Cellar/httpd/2.4.33/share/ma
  ==> make install
  ==> Caveats
  DocumentRoot is /usr/local/homebrew/var/www.

  The default ports have been set in /usr/local/homebrew/etc/httpd/httpd.conf to 8080 and in
  /usr/local/homebrew/etc/httpd/extra/httpd-ssl.conf to 8443 so that httpd can run without sudo.

  To have launchd start httpd now and restart at login:
    brew services start httpd
    Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
      apachectl start
