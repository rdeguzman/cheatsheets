	==> Caveats
	Plugins for this version of GDAL/OGR, generated by other formulae, should
	be symlinked to the following directory:
	
	  /usr/local/homebrew/lib/gdalplugins/2.3
	
	You may need to set the following enviroment variable:
	
	  export GDAL_DRIVER_PATH=/usr/local/homebrew/lib/gdalplugins
	
	PYTHON BINDINGS are now built in a separate formula: gdal2-python
	
	This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local/homebrew,
	because older version of gdal is in main tap and installs similar components.
	
	If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
	  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/homebrew/opt/gdal2/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
	
	For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
	    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/homebrew/opt/gdal2/lib
	    CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/homebrew/opt/gdal2/include
	For pkg-config to find this software you may need to set:
	    PKG_CONFIG_PATH: /usr/local/homebrew/opt/gdal2/lib/pkgconfig
